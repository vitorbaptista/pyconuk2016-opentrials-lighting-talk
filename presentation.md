# What are clinical trials?

---

# Let me tell you a story

---

# TGN1412 (a.k.a the Elephant Man trial)

---

# March 2006 in London

---

# Six volunteers paid 2,000 pounds each

---

# In the first hour

---

# Headaches

---

# Muscle aches

---

# Feeling of unease

---

# After some time...

---

# High temperatures

---

# Restlessness

---

# Forgot who and where they were

---

# Shivering

---

# Flushing

---

# Pulse racing

---

# Falling blood pressure

---

# One went into respiratory failure

---

# Another dropped his blood pressure and stopped breathing properly

---

# Went to intensive care

---

# Within a day all were disastrously unwell

---

# Ventilated on intensive care

---

# ... and other bad things

---

# Thankfully, with heroic effort, all escaped

---

# Could this have been prevented?

---

# Yes

---

# Previous study with a similar intervention

---

# Conducted **10 years** before

---

# Unpublished

---

# FDA: US Food and Drug Administration
